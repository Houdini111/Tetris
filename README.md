As of the alpha release, there are still some features that do not have menu options to edit. Most notably, you can edit board height and width.    
You can edit these via the ini located in the AppData directory (typically `C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Tetris\settings.ini`)  

As of right now I have not bothered to make anything other than Windows executables.  
If you encounter any issues or would like to request features, feel free to [make an issue](https://github.com/Houdini111/Tetris/issues/new) .
